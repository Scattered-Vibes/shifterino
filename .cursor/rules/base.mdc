# Base Guidelines

- **TypeScript First**  
  • Write all code in TypeScript.  
  • Avoid using `any`—prefer interfaces over types.  
  • Enable strict type checking.

- **Project Structure**  
  • Use a clear folder structure:  
  - `app/` for Next.js pages, layouts, and route groups.  
  - `components/` for shared UI components.  
  - `lib/` for utilities, helpers, and business logic.  
  - `styles/` for Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules.
  
- **Styling & Documentation**  
  • Use Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules consistently.  
  • Update documentation and rule files as the project evolves.
