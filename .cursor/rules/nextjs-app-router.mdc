# Next.js App Router Guidelines

- **Server Components by Default**  
  • Leverage server components unless client interactivity is required.

- **File Structure & Routing**  
  • Use route groups (e.g. `(auth)`, `(dashboard)`) for logical grouping without affecting URL paths.  
  • Define a root layout (e.g. `layout.tsx`) for shared UI and metadata.  
  • Create `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` files for managing loading states and error handling.

- **Metadata & Server Actions**  
  • Define metadata for SEO in `layout.tsx` (use Next.js’s Metadata object).  
  • Use server actions (in files like `actions.ts`) for form submissions and backend interactions.

- **Best Practices**  
  • Maintain kebab-case for file names.  
  • Co-locate tests with components for better maintainability.
