# Scheduling System Guidelines

- **Staffing Requirements**  
  • Ensure defined minimum staffing per time block:  
  - 5:00 AM – 9:00 AM: ≥6 employees with at least 1 supervisor.  
  - 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM: ≥8 employees with at least 1 supervisor.  
  - 9:00 PM – 1:00 AM: ≥7 employees with at least 1 supervisor.  
  - 1:00 AM – 5:00 AM: ≥6 employees with at least 1 supervisor.

- **Shift Patterns & Constraints**  
  • **Pattern A:** Four consecutive 10-hour shifts.  
  • **Pattern B:** Three consecutive 12-hour shifts plus one 4-hour shift.  
  • Enforce a 40-hour weekly cap unless manually overridden.

- **Time Off Management & Overtime**  
  • Do not schedule during approved time-off periods.  
  • Avoid scheduling during pending requests unless staffing requirements mandate otherwise.

- **Schedule Generation & Validation**  
  • Generate schedules using server actions that assign supervisors first, then staff.  
  • Validate schedules for understaffing, missing supervisors, pattern violations, and overtime.
