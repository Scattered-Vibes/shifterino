# Testing Patterns

- **Co-located Tests**  
  • Place tests close to the components they verify (e.g. `Button.test.tsx` alongside `Button.tsx`).

- **Unit Tests**  
  • Use frameworks such as Vitest and React Testing Library for testing isolated logic.

- **Integration and API Tests**  
  • Test interactions between components and API endpoints.  
  • Verify error states and edge cases.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**  
  • Use Playwright for complete user flow tests covering authentication, scheduling, and real-time updates.

- **Organizational Structure**  
  • Organize tests in directories such as `__tests__/unit`, `__tests__/integration`, and `__tests__/e2e` for clarity.
