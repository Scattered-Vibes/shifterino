### In Progress 🚧

#### Phase 2: Frontend Development
- [ ] Employee Dashboard Component (Not Started)
- [ ] Shared Schedule Viewer Component (Started)
- [ ] UI Controls for Shift Selection (Started)

### Next Steps 📋

1. **Immediate Tasks**
   - Create Employee Dashboard component
   - Test Manager Dashboard components
   - Add error handling to forms
   - Implement optimistic updates

2. **Upcoming Phase Work**
   - Complete Phase 2 (Frontend Development)
   - Begin Phase 3 (Backend Development)
   - Implement scheduling algorithm

### Technical Debt 🔧
- Need to address remaining linter warnings in server.ts
- Need to implement proper error handling in authentication flow
- Need to add loading states to components
- Need to add error boundaries
- Need to implement optimistic updates
- Need to add form validation

### UI Components Status 🎨
Installed and Implemented:
- Button (used in all components)
- Card (used in layout)
- Table (used in StaffingOverview, TimeOffRequests, ScheduleManager, StaffList)
- Calendar (used in ScheduleManager)
- Form (used in StaffList)
- Input (used in StaffList)
- Select (used in ScheduleManager, StaffList)
- Sheet (pending use)
- Tabs (used in Manager Dashboard)
- Dialog (used in TimeOffRequests, ScheduleManager, StaffList)

### Database Schema Status 📊
Implemented tables:
- employees (with auth integration)
- schedules (with shift management)
- time_off_requests (with approval workflow)
- overtime_approvals (with supervisor approval)

Added features:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Proper indexing for performance
- Automated timestamp handling
- Custom types for shift patterns and statuses

### Project Structure Status
Following Next.js 14 App Router conventions:
```

│   └── login/
├── (dashboard)/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── manage/
│   │   ├── page.tsx

```

### Environment & Dependencies
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Supabase for authentication and database
- Shadcn UI (installed and configured)

### Known Issues 🐛
1. Cookie handling warnings in development (being addressed)
2. Need to implement proper error boundaries
3. Authentication flow needs refinement
4. Migration script needs superuser privileges fix
5. Form validation needed in all forms
6. Loading states needed in all components

### Next Meeting Agenda
1. Review implemented Manager Dashboard components
2. Plan Employee Dashboard implementation
3. Discuss error handling and form validation approach

### Notes
- Following cursor rules for file structure and naming
- Implementing modern Next.js patterns with App Router
- Using Supabase SSR package for authentication
- Database schema supports all required scheduling patterns
- Added comprehensive TypeScript types for type safety
- UI components follow Shadcn's New York style with neutral color scheme
- Manager Dashboard components implemented with proper separation of concerns
