1. Introduction

This document describes an enhanced scheduling system for a 911 dispatch center that operates 24/7. Given the critical nature of emergency services, the system must reliably meet staffing requirements while considering employee preferences, fairness, fatigue management, and regulatory constraints. This version builds upon previous logic by incorporating detailed decision criteria, improved conflict resolution, and real-time adjustment mechanisms.



2. System Objectives and Key Improvements

Primary Objectives:
	•	Continuous Coverage: Guarantee that every time block (morning, day, evening, night) meets minimum staffing and supervisory requirements.
	•	Employee Satisfaction: Respect employee shift pattern preferences, time-off requests, and fairness in shift distribution.
	•	Operational Flexibility: Provide robust mechanisms for real-time adjustments and conflict resolution.
	•	Scalability and Performance: Ensure the system can efficiently generate and update schedules over extended periods (e.g., four months) for an increasing number of employees.
	•	Transparency: Offer detailed logging, error handling, and an intuitive user interface for schedulers and employees.

Key Improvements Over Previous Logic:
	•	Detailed Scoring System: A quantified decision matrix with weighted factors (e.g., shift preference, recency of similar shifts, weekly hours, fatigue considerations) is introduced.
	•	Clear Fallback Procedures: Explicit steps for when conflicts or constraint violations occur, including escalation paths and manual override protocols.
	•	Enhanced Error Handling: Granular logging and error detection mechanisms that facilitate quick resolution and continuous improvement.
	•	Real-Time Adjustments: A dedicated module for handling unscheduled absences, sudden demand changes, and shift swaps.
	•	Improved Integration: Clearer pathways for integrating with external systems (e.g., payroll, time-off management, machine learning prediction engines).



3. Detailed Staffing Requirements and Constraints

The dispatch center operates on a 24/7 schedule with the following staffing requirements:
	•	Morning:
	•	Time: 5:00 AM – 9:00 AM
	•	Requirement: Minimum 6 employees, including 1 shift supervisor.
	•	Daytime:
	•	Time: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM
	•	Requirement: Minimum 8 employees, including 1 shift supervisor.
	•	Evening:
	•	Time: 9:00 PM – 1:00 AM
	•	Requirement: Minimum 7 employees, including 1 shift supervisor.
	•	Night:
	•	Time: 1:00 AM – 5:00 AM
	•	Requirement: Minimum 6 employees, including 1 shift supervisor.

Additional Constraints:
	•	Weekly Hours Cap: Employees should not exceed 40 hours per week unless overtime is approved.
	•	Shift Consistency: Employees should generally work the same type of shift (e.g., day or night) on their scheduled days.
	•	Time-Off Requests: Approved requests are mandatory; pending requests are accommodated when possible.
	•	Fatigue and Rest: Incorporate minimum rest periods (as defined in shift pattern rules) to prevent fatigue.
	•	Fairness: Distribute shifts equitably and minimize overtime imbalances.

5. Enhanced Scheduling Algorithm

The scheduling algorithm is divided into six phases. Each phase incorporates improvements to ensure clarity, robustness, and scalability.



Phase 1: Initialization and Data Preparation
	1.	Create Schedule Period:
	•	Insert a new record in schedule_periods with the desired four-month timeframe.
	•	Include a description and any special notes for the period.
	2.	Populate Staffing Requirements:
	•	Insert or update staffing_requirements records for each time block and day of the week.
	•	Use a configurable approach that allows different requirements for holidays or special events (leveraging the system_settings table if needed).
	3.	Load Data:
	•	Retrieve current employee data, shift options, time-off requests, and shift pattern rules.
	•	Pre-compute employee availability, taking into account approved time-off requests.
	4.	Cache Configurable Parameters:
	•	Load any system settings (e.g., weights for the scoring system, maximum shift swap attempts, fallback rules) from the system_settings table.



Phase 2: Daily Schedule Generation
	1.	Iterate Over Days:
	•	Loop through each day in the schedule period.
	2.	Iterate Over Staffing Blocks:
	•	For each day, iterate over every staffing requirement block (morning, day, evening, night).
	3.	Employee Selection and Assignment:
	•	Availability Check: Filter employees who are available (i.e., not on approved time off or already over their weekly cap).
	•	Shift Pattern Matching: Ensure employees are considered only for shifts matching their designated shift pattern.
	•	Supervisor Priority: For blocks requiring a supervisor, first select from employees with the “Supervisor” role.
	•	Scoring System:
	•	Apply the detailed scoring function (see Section 6) to rank eligible employees.
	•	Use weighted factors such as:
	•	Preferred Shift Category: Higher weight for exact matches.
	•	Time Since Last Similar Shift: Prioritize those who have not worked that shift recently.
	•	Weekly Hours Balance: Factor in the current week’s hours to avoid overscheduling.
	•	Fatigue and Rest: Factor in minimum rest hours and recent workload intensity.
	•	Employee Requests and Historical Fairness: Adjust scores based on past shift distributions.
	•	Assignment:
	•	Assign the highest-scoring employee to the corresponding shift_option that satisfies the block’s start and end times.
	•	Update employee_schedules accordingly.
	•	Fallback Procedures:
	•	If no candidate meets all criteria, relax non-critical constraints (e.g., secondary preferences) and escalate through pre-defined fallback rules.
	•	If a supervisor cannot be found, log an error with severity “ERROR” and flag for immediate manual review.



Phase 3: Shift Pattern Enforcement and Flexibility
	1.	Review Scheduled Shifts:
	•	Post assignment, iterate through each employee’s shifts in the period.
	•	Validate that the shifts conform to their assigned shift pattern (e.g., consecutive shifts, rest hours).
	2.	Conflict Resolution:
	•	For any violation (e.g., insufficient rest period):
	•	Automated Swapping: Attempt to swap shifts between two eligible employees.
	•	Local Adjustments: Adjust timing within a tolerable window if allowed by the rules.
	•	Logging and Manual Override: If automated resolution fails, log the event and mark it for manual intervention via the scheduler dashboard.
	3.	Flexible Pattern Overrides:
	•	Allow for temporary overrides in emergencies or peak demand scenarios.
	•	Document overrides in scheduling_logs with detailed rationale.



Phase 4: Overtime Management and Weekly Hours Calculation
	1.	Calculate Weekly Hours:
	•	Compute total scheduled hours per employee per week.
	•	Use these totals to ensure that the weekly cap is respected unless overtime is explicitly approved.
	2.	Assign Overtime Fairly:
	•	If additional staffing is needed, assign overtime while distributing extra hours equitably.
	•	Track overtime hours in employee_schedules (flagged with is_overtime = true) and log assignments.
	3.	Dynamic Overtime Adjustment:
	•	Monitor real-time changes (e.g., last-minute absences) and adjust overtime assignments accordingly.
	•	Use a fairness factor that prioritizes employees with minimal recent overtime.



Phase 5: Validation, Logging, and Conflict Resolution
	1.	Validation Checks:
	•	Confirm that every staffing block meets its minimum employee and supervisor requirements.
	•	Ensure that no employee exceeds their weekly hours cap (unless within approved overtime).
	•	Validate adherence to shift pattern rules.
	2.	Generate Detailed Reports:
	•	Create daily and weekly reports showing:
	•	Staffing levels.
	•	Employee assignments.
	•	Overtime hours.
	•	Detected conflicts or pattern violations.
	3.	Comprehensive Logging:
	•	Record each significant scheduling decision, conflict, adjustment, and manual override in scheduling_logs.
	•	Include severity levels and detailed messages to aid troubleshooting.



Phase 6: Real-Time Adjustments and Dashboard Interface
	1.	Real-Time Adjustment Module:
	•	Integrate a parallel process to handle sudden staffing changes (e.g., employee absences, emergency shift swaps).
	•	Use event-driven updates to adjust schedules immediately, with a short re-computation cycle for affected blocks.
	2.	Scheduler Dashboard:
	•	Develop a web-based interface where administrators can:
	•	View real-time schedule status.
	•	Trigger manual overrides and shift swaps.
	•	Review logs and validation reports.
	•	Approve overtime and resolve conflicts flagged by the system.
	3.	Employee Self-Service Portal:
	•	Allow employees to:
	•	View their scheduled shifts and overtime hours.
	•	Submit time-off requests.
	•	Request shift swaps (which are recorded in shift_swap_requests).



6. Detailed Scoring System and Decision Matrix

The scoring system is central to the selection of the best candidate for each shift. Here is a detailed example of the decision matrix:

Factor	Weight	Description	Scoring Example
Preferred Shift Category	10	Full match between employee’s preference and shift category.	Match = +10; Partial = +5; No match = 0
Time Since Last Similar Shift	8	Longer gaps since last similar shift yield higher scores (promotes fairness).	>72 hours = +8; 48-72 hours = +5; <48 hours = 0
Weekly Hours Balance	7	Lower cumulative hours this week result in higher scores.	<30 hours = +7; 30-40 hours = +3; >40 hours = 0
Fatigue/Rest Compliance	5	Ensures compliance with minimum rest hours; violations heavily penalized.	Compliant = +5; Borderline = +2; Violation = -10
Historical Fairness	5	Prioritize employees who have received fewer “desirable” shifts in recent cycles.	Low count = +5; Medium = +2; High count = 0
Employee Special Requests	5	Extra points for employees who have requested a particular shift in advance.	Request match = +5; No request = 0

Overall Score:
The candidate with the highest aggregate score is selected. In cases of a tie, secondary factors (e.g., lower current weekly hours or longer rest since the last shift) serve as tie-breakers.

Fallback Procedure:
	•	If no candidate achieves a minimum threshold (set via system_settings), relax lower-weight criteria sequentially until a candidate is found.
	•	If no candidate meets even relaxed criteria, flag the situation for manual review with a detailed log entry.



7. Error Handling, Logging, and Manual Overrides
	•	Granular Logging:
	•	Every decision, conflict, or override is recorded in scheduling_logs with fields for timestamp, severity, and descriptive messages.
	•	Log categories include: INFO (routine operations), WARNING (minor issues or adjustments), and ERROR (critical issues requiring immediate attention).
	•	Manual Override Interface:
	•	The scheduler dashboard provides tools to manually adjust schedules when automated processes cannot resolve conflicts.
	•	Each manual override is logged, with the responsible manager’s auth_id recorded.
	•	Fallback and Escalation:
	•	The system automatically escalates unresolved conflicts to a designated “manager review” queue.
	•	Email or in-app notifications alert administrators to critical scheduling conflicts.



8. Integration, Performance, and Scalability Considerations
	•	Integration with External Systems:
	•	Payroll: Automate payroll calculations based on data from employee_schedules (including overtime and shift differentials).
	•	Time-Off Management: Seamless integration via API with HR systems for automatic time-off approvals and updates.
	•	Machine Learning Modules: Future integration to predict staffing needs based on historical data and trends.
	•	Performance Optimization:
	•	Caching: Frequently accessed data (e.g., employee availability, system settings) is cached.
	•	Batch Processing: Schedule generation is optimized using batch processing for long scheduling periods.
	•	Database Indexing: Key fields (e.g., date, employee_id, schedule_period_id) are indexed for rapid query response.
	•	Scalability:
	•	The modular database design and algorithmic structure allow horizontal scaling.
	•	Cloud-based deployment and load balancing ensure the system remains responsive even as the number of employees and shifts grows.



9. Future Enhancements and Optimization Algorithms
	•	Advanced Optimization Techniques:
	•	Explore constraint programming and genetic algorithms to further improve schedule quality.
	•	Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning:
	•	Use historical data to predict peak staffing needs and preemptively adjust schedules.
	•	Real-Time Communication:
	•	Integrate mobile notifications for last-minute schedule changes and emergency adjustments.
	•	Enhanced User Experience:
	•	Continuous UX testing with dispatch center staff to improve both the scheduler dashboard and employee portal.
	•	Automated Conflict Resolution:
	•	Develop self-healing algorithms that dynamically adjust schedules with minimal manual intervention.
